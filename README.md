# Terraform URL Download Speedtest / Cache Test 
- Deploys Lambda functions to all available locations and outputs a list of URLs
- URLs can be utilised to test cache hit/miss status from different locations globally
- Outputs speed (time to download file) in Mbps, seconds taken, and cache hit/miss.


I'll release a bulk tester once it's finalised too... But be warned this chews through Lambda free quota quick.
